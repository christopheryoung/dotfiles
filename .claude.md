Working style
=============

Let's use Test Driven Development unless otherwise instructed. Generally, we
want to encode a requirement in a test, run the test to confirm that it fails,
and then write code that meaningfully passes the test.

There is no need to ask me before running tests.

You'll find next steps for a project in a `todo.md` and a specification of the
project (if one exists) in `spec.md`.

We should use `hypothesis` for tests whereever reasonable. Install it once it
seems useful.

Let's use `pytest` to run the tests and for fixtures, etc.

After each unit of work is completed, and the tests are passing, we should
pause to commit the change with a descriptive commit message.

Before committing, we should lint the code using `ruff`.

Readability is a high priority. After each commit, we should review the code to
see if there is obvious repetition that can be abstracted away. Of course,
"drying out" the code can easily go too far, but there is a sweet spot in terms
of readability. This can go into a separate commit.

Functions and methods should have doc strings.

Let's type annotate function and method signatures; no need to type annotate
variables.

I prefer line lengths to be 80 characters.

Please don't leave extra whitespace around when you write code.

I like imports to follow the qualified style. E.g., `from x.y import z` and
then use as `z.foo`. And let's have one import per line.
