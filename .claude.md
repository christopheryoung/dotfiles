Working style
=============

Let's use Test Driven Development unless otherwise instructed. Generally, we
want to encode a requirement in a test, run the test to confirm that it fails,
and then write code that meaningfully passes the test.

You'll find next steps for a project in a `todo.md` and a specification of the
project in `spec.md`.

We should use `hypothesis` for tests whereever reasonable.

After each unit of work is completed, and the tests are passing, we should
pause to commit the change with a reasonable commit message.

Before committing, we should lint the code using `ruff`.

Readability is a high priority. After each commit, we should review the code to
see if there is obvious repetition that can be abstracted away. Of course,
drying out the code can easily go too far, but there is a sweet spot in terms
of readability. This can go into a separate commit.

After you work on or add a method, you should write a doc string for the
method.

Let's type annotate function and method signatures; no need to type annotate
variables.

Preferred Tooling
=================

Most projects will use `uv`. Expect a project to be runnable with `uv run
<entry_point>` and the tests to be run `uv run pytest`.

`uv` and `ruff` have already been brew installed on the machine.

Standard developer tools include: `ipython`, `pytest` and `hypothesis`
(for testing), `coverage`.
